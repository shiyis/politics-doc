**Introduction: Exploratory Analysis of Federal Election Candidacy**

This study delves into the world of federal election candidacy, aiming to understand how candidates run for office, who supports them financially, and how geography influences their campaigns.

On the demo website, I have created visualization in order to,

**Understand PAC Finance:**

- Political Action Committees (PACs) are groups that raise money to support political candidates.
- PACs can donate money directly to candidates or spend money on advertising and other activities to support them.
- By analyzing PAC finance data, we can see which PACs are supporting which candidates and how much money they're giving.

**Explore Geographic Data:**

- Geography plays a big role in elections. Different areas have different kinds of voters and different issues that matter to them.
- We'll use geographic data to see where candidates are getting support from and where they're spending their time campaigning.
- By looking at maps and demographic information, we can learn about the communities that candidates are trying to reach.

**Why This Matters:**

- Understanding how candidates raise and spend money, as well as where they focus their efforts, helps us understand the electoral process.
- By analyzing this data, we can identify trends and patterns that might influence election outcomes.
- This information can also help voters make informed decisions about who to support and why.

**Our Approach:**

- We'll collect data on campaign finance, PAC contributions, and geographic information.
- Using statistical analysis and visualization techniques, we'll explore the relationships between these different factors.
- Our goal is to uncover insights that shed light on how federal election campaigns work and how geography and finance intersect in the electoral process.

**Conclusion:**

- By taking a closer look at federal election candidacy through the lens of PAC finance and geographic data, we hope to gain a better understanding of how elections are won and lost.
- Our analysis aims to provide a clear picture of the dynamics at play in the electoral process, helping to inform future research and decision-making.
