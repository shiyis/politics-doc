Measuring political sentiment and polarization is a common practice in the realm of social science research. However, it may also be applicable to solving business problems, like providing more information about a certain candidate to voters to fill the information gap and facilitate voting processes.

Website like OpenSecrets provides valuable educational information to start. This project tries to top it off by retrieving organic information (tweets) about said candidates and conducting analysis accordingly.
