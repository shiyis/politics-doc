**Introduction: Exploratory Analysis of Federal Election Candidacy**

This study delves into the world of federal election candidacy, aiming to understand how candidates run for office, who supports them financially, and how geography influences their campaigns. In the demo website, I have created visualization in order to,

**Understand PAC Finance:**

- Political Action Committees (PACs) are groups that raise money to support political candidates.
- PACs can donate money directly to candidates or spend money on advertising and other activities to support them.
- By analyzing PAC finance data, we can see which PACs are supporting which candidates and how much money they're giving.

**Explore Geographic Data:**

- Geography plays a big role in elections. Different areas have different kinds of voters and different issues that matter to them.
- We'll use geographic data to see where candidates are getting support from and where they're spending their time campaigning.
- By looking at maps and demographic information, we can learn about the communities that candidates are trying to reach.

**Why This Matters:**

- Understanding how candidates raise and spend money, as well as where they focus their efforts, helps us understand the electoral process.
- By analyzing this data, we can identify trends and patterns that might influence election outcomes.
- This information can also help voters make informed decisions about who to support and why.

**The Approach:**

- We'll collect data on campaign finance, PAC contributions, and geographic information.
- Using statistical analysis and visualization techniques, we'll explore the relationships between these different factors.
- Our goal is to uncover insights that shed light on how federal election campaigns work and how geography and finance intersect in the electoral process.

**Conclusion:**

- By taking a closer look at federal election candidacy through the lens of PAC finance and geographic data, we hope to gain a better understanding of how elections are won and lost.
- Our analysis aims to provide a clear picture of the dynamics at play in the electoral process, helping to inform future research and decision-making.

**More on Super PACs, Campaign Finances, And Independent Expenditures**

The Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission (2010) decision had a significant impact on the formation of super PACs, leading to a proliferation of these entities and a dramatic increase in their influence on the political landscape. Here's how:

**Removal of spending limits**


- The Citizens United decision struck down a key provision of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (BCRA), also known as McCain-Feingold, which prohibited corporations and labor unions from spending money on electioneering communications (ads, etc.) that mentioned a candidate's name within 30 days of a primary or 60 days of a general election.

- This ruling effectively removed limits on independent expenditures by corporations, labor unions, and other organizations.

**Creation of super PACs**

- In response to the Citizens United decision, the Federal Election Commission (FEC) issued new rules in 2010, allowing for the creation of super PACs.

- These entities, also known as independent expenditure-only committees, can raise and spend unlimited amounts of money to support or oppose candidates, as long as they do not coordinate with the candidates or their campaigns.


**Unlimited fundraising**

- Super PACs can accept unlimited contributions from individuals, corporations, labor unions, and other organizations.

- This allows them to raise massive amounts of money, often from a small group of wealthy donors.


**Increased influence**

- With unlimited fundraising capabilities, super PACs can spend enormous sums on advertising, voter mobilization, and other campaign activities, giving them significant influence over the political process.


**Anonymity**

- While super PACs are required to disclose their donors to the FEC, some donors can remain anonymous by contributing to non-profit organizations, known as 501(c)(4) groups, which can then donate to super PACs. This lack of transparency has raised concerns about the potential for dark money to influence elections.

**Proliferation of super PACs**

- Since the Citizens United decision, the number of super PACs has grown exponentially.

- According to the Center for Responsive Politics, there were over 2,000 super PACs registered with the FEC in the 2020 election cycle, compared to just 83 in the 2010 cycle.

- Shift in political power: The rise of super PACs has shifted power from traditional political parties and candidates to these outside groups, which can now wield significant influence over the political process.


In summary, the Citizens United decision paved the way for the creation of super PACs, which can raise and spend unlimited amounts of money to influence elections. This has led to a significant increase in the influence of outside groups on the political process, raising concerns about the impact of money on politics and the potential for dark money to shape election outcomes.
